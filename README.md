# :recycle: Ecoleta

Project developed during RocketSeat's Next Level Week 1.0, between June 1st and 7th, 2020.

This application uses TypeScript with NodeJS, ReactJS and React Native.

The solution aims to serve as a marketplace for waste collection, where owners of waste processing sites can register their businesses, and users can find them and contact them, to properly dispose their wastes.
